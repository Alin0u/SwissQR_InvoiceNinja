## Introduction
I found myself facing the problem of the creation of a Swiss QR code for 
invoices using NinjaInvoice. This small but crucial component was a missing
piece in my invoicing workflow, and it became clear that there might be
others in the NinjaInvoice community facing the same challenge.

This repository was crafted to offer a simple, efficient, and free solution 
for anyone looking to integrate Swiss QR codes into their invoices 
using NinjaInvoice.
